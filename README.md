### Intro

1. Creates a bucket in Google Cloud Storage for a particular project
2. Loads information from a url that downloads a file such as a .csv file from a website like kaggle
3. Stores the file into the bucket in Google Cloud Storage
4. Loads the file into BigQuery and performs desired queries onto the dataset
5. Transfers queries into local computer
